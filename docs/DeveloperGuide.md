### Architecture

<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.puml" width="574" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** (consisting of classes [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2425S2-CS2103T-F14-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2425S2-CS2103T-F14-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java)) is in charge of the app launch and shut down.
* At app launch, it initializes the other components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down, it shuts down the other components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

The bulk of the app's work is done by the following four components:

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete n/Alice`.

<puml src="diagrams/DeleteArchitectureSequenceDiagram.puml" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<puml src="diagrams/ComponentManagers.puml" width="300">

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Person` object residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:
<puml src="diagrams/LogicClassDiagram.puml" width="550" />

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component, taking `execute("delete n/Alice")` API call as an example.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete n/Alice` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline continues till the end of diagram.
</div>

How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it is passed to an `AddressBookParser` object which in turn creates a parser that matches the command (e.g., `DeleteCommandParser`) and uses it to parse the command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `DeleteCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to delete a person).<br>
   Note that although this is shown as a single step in the diagram above (for simplicity), in the code it can take several interactions (between the command object and the `Model`) to achieve.
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:
<puml src="diagrams/ParserClasses.puml" width="600" />

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)
<puml src="diagrams/ModelClassDiagram.puml" width="450" />


The `Model` component,

* stores the address book data i.e., all `Person` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePersonList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Person` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user’s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `AddressBook`, which `Person` references. This allows `AddressBook` to only require one `Tag` object per unique tag, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` objects.<br>
<puml src="diagrams/BetterModelClassDiagram.puml" width="450" />

</div>


### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)
<puml src="diagrams/StorageClassDiagram.puml" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both address book data and user preference data in  format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `AddressBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.address.commons` package.

### Saving, Loading, and Managing Files

#### Saving Data

1. **Test Case:**
    ```
    save test
    ```  
   **Expected:** The current address book data is saved to a file named `test.json` in the default directory (a folder named `data` in the current directory storing the program's jar file), and a success message is displayed in the status bar.

2. **Test Case:**
    ```
    save
    ```  
   **Expected:** An error message indicating that a filename is required.

3. **Test Case:**
    ```
    save [invalid/filename]
    ```  
   **Expected:** The command will not be run

#### Loading Data

1. **Preparation:** Ensure a valid  file (e.g., `example.json`) exists in the default directory (a folder named `data` in the current directory storing the program's jar file). You can run `save example` before this to ensure this. Reminder that in the json file will need to have all attributes for each person object except `tutorials` and `tags` to be valid.

2. **Test Case:**
    ```
    load example
    ```  
   **Expected:** The address book data is replaced with the contents of `example.json`, with a success message in the status bar.

3. **Test Case:**
    ```
    load nonExistentFile
    ```  
   **Expected:** An error message indicating that the specified file does not exist.
4. **Test Case:**
  Go to the saved `example.json` file saved in the default directory. Then change the value of the files (E.g. duplicate an entry or delete an entry's student ID) to make the file invalid.
  Then run:
    ```
    load example
    ```  
   **Expected:** An error message indicating that the file is corrupted or invalid.

#### Listing All Saved Files

1. **Test Case:**
    ```
    files
    ```  
   **Expected:** A list of all saved files in the default directory is displayed in the result panel.
2. **Test Case:**
    ```
    files
    ```  
   when no files exist  
   **Expected:** A message is displayed indicating that no saved files are available.

#### Dealing with Missing/Corrupted Data Files

1. **Simulating a Missing File:**
    - Manually rename or remove the data file (e.g., `addressbook.json`).
    - Launch the application.
    - **Expected Behavior:** The app detects the absence of the file, recreates it with default data, and logs a warning message.
2. **Simulating a Corrupted File:**
    - Open the data file (e.g., `addressbook.json`) in a text editor.
    - Modify its content so that it is not valid JSON (for example, delete or alter key structural elements).
    - Launch the application.
    - **Expected Behavior:** The app notifies the user about the corrupted file, attempts to restore data from a backup if available, or resets to a default state while logging the error.

### Additional Exploratory Testing

- **Invalid Command Formats:**  
  Try commands with typos or extra spaces (e.g., `add  n/Mai  p/12341234`) and verify that the app returns a clear error message.
- **Field Boundary Testing:**  
  Test the input constraints for each field. For example, provide an incorrectly formatted student ID, non-alphanumeric characters in tag names, or an invalid phone number format.
- **User Interface:**  
  Verify that all GUI components (such as the status bar, menus, and command box) behave as expected during and after executing commands.
- **Error Logging:**  
  Check that the status bar and any log files (if applicable) accurately report errors and warnings.

## **Appendix: Planned Enhancements**

**Team Size:** 4

1. **Make email field unique and follows NUS email format**: Currently, the add command allows the same email to be added,
and it does not have to follow NUS email format (@nus.edu.sg). We plan to improve it by making the email field unique,
and only NUS email can be added.


2. **Make tutorial field follow NUS courses format**: Currently, the tutorial can just take in any string, not necessarily 
in the format of a course code (e.g CS2103T). We plan to improve it by making it follow NUS course code format.<br>


3. **List all students after delete command**: If a user use the find command to filter out a student, and then use delete
command to delete the student, the app will display a blank list. We plan to update it to display the whole list after
the delete command is called.<br>
